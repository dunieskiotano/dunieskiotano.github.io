Hello, my name is **Dunieski Otano** and I am originally from Cuba. I studied **English Language and Literature** in the University of Havana, Cuba and graduated in 2002. 

In 2011 I finished my **Master's Degree in Curriculum & Instruction with concentration in ESOL** in Concordia University- Portland, OR. A few years later, I decided to change my career path and went for a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering** from Keiser University and graduated in 2017. Since then I have been developing software, creating websites, full stack applications, and gettting expertise in AWS services. I recently got AWS certified as a cloud practitioner.
