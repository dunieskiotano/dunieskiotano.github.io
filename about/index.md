Hello, my name is **Dunieski Otano** and I am originally from Cuba. I studied **English Language and Literature** in the University of Havana, Cuba and graduated in 2002. 

In 2011 I finished my **Master's Degree in Curriculum & Instruction with concentration in ESOL** in Concordia University- Portland, OR. A few years later, I decided to change my career path and went for a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering** from Keiser University and graduated in 2017. 

Since my graduation as a software engineer, I have been developing software, creating websites, full stack applications, and getting expertise in AWS services. I am an [**AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=9&t=c&d=2019-08-06&ci=AWS00993439), [**AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=3&t=c&d=2019-09-10&ci=AWS00993439), [**AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=1&t=c&d=2019-10-17&ci=AWS00993439), [**AWS Certified Developer Associate**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=2&t=c&d=2019-12-10&ci=AWS00993439), amd [**AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=5&t=c&d=2020-03-06&ci=AWS00993439)

I am currently doing my **Master's Degree in Computer Science**.
